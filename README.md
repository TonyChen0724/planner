# ePlanner
SYNPOSIS:
This XCode project is a planner app that allows students to organise their lecture times, deadlines, tasks and group meetings. At center, this app is managed by a tab bar controller that controls the timetable, deadlines, tasks and meetings tab. The timetable tab allows students to add in 1 hour events between times 8am and 7pm. Deadlines and meetings can also be added into the timetable by separate tabs. The timetable thereby provides an environment to view a students full timetable. The deadlines, tasks and meetings tab allow students to create new events and view them in a separate designated view.

CODE EXAMPLE:


MOTIVATION:
The project was motivated by the lack of flexibility and accessibility of our current student timetabling system. Our urrent student timetabling system isn't user-friendly, the display is not adapted for mobile devices and requires too much web browsing to access. We aim to make an app that is user-friendly and something students will use frequently.

INSTALLATION:
To install and run the program: first clone the ePlanner project file, second open 'ePlanner.xcworkspace' and third, run the project in an iphone7 simulator. 

TESTING:
After having opened the app in an iphone7 simulator, you can add events to the timetable through the timetables, deadlines and meetings tabs. You can also add deadlines, meetings and tasks which will appear in there own respective screens. 
Deadlines have the ability to be stored in our database. So after adding deadlines, you can shut down the app and when you reload it, the added deadlines will remain displayed in the tab's table view. We haven't implemented this saving feature in the other tabs yet.
To delete events from the timetable, you can simply tap the cell you want to delete and a pop up message will appear where you can confirm the deletion. In the deadlines, meetings and tasks tab, you can delete an event by touching an event and dragging to the left. A delete button will appear which allows you to remove the event.
